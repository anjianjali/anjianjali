            <p class="" style="padding:1em;">
            Our dreams started getting in shape when an industrious doctor running an NGO ( Proyas Therapeutic Rehabilitation Center )for specially abled kids decided to join, thus laying the foundation of this team. Likewise other individuals- Engineers, Graphic Artists, teachers and NGO workers helped realize our collective dreams justifying the quote, "In a competition, individual ambition serve the common goal."

Education saves lives, fosters peace, strengthens the rights of women and girls, and promotes economic growth. Team Krishna believes that every child is special and it is only through education that we can help them shine, that we can help them reach their full potential. An educated young generation would make a peaceful and educated nation. Our future lies in the hands of children of today. So we are here to wash off the global learning crisis, promise a hassle free life to the destitute children by helping them embrace education in an exciting and engaging way. We are here to strive, to seek, to find and not to yield.

            <p class="" style="padding:1em;">
           PTRC via Dr.Amit Chowdhury is the official partner of Team Krishna for Global Learning XPrize. PTRC has been the backbone of the team, and it is one of the reasons for what Team Krishna is striving for today.

Founded on 31st March 2013 PTRC is an NGO based in Bally, Kolkata dedicated solely for the purpose of providing rehabilitation to Specially Abled Kids. The trust had been formed under the leadership of Dr.Amit Chowdhury who himself being an occupational therapist wanted to help underprivileged Specially Abled Kids by therapeutic techniques at minimal cost.

Dr.Amit Chowdhury initially bootstrapped this organization by funding it solely from his stipend allowances which he received during his masters course before having enough number of patients to help self sustain the organization and as well as rent a small place for his organization.

The mission of PTRC has been to raise awareness and help those people who are in need of the therapeutic treatment (Occupational therapy, Physiotherapy, Speech therapy & Special education) apart from providing equipments such as wheelchair & tricycle as per the needs of patient at minimum or zero cost.
